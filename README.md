Data Mining Unsupervised Learning / Descriptive Modeling - Association Rule Mining

# Problem Statement:
    Q1. Kitabi Duniya, a famous bookstore in India, was established before Independence, the growth of the company was incremental
    year by year, but due to the online selling of books and widespread Internet access, its annual growth started to
    collapse. As a Data Scientist, you must help this heritage bookstore gain its popularity back    and increase the 
    footfall of customers and provide ways to improve the business exponentially to an expected value at a 25% improvement 
    of the current rate. Apply the pattern mining techniques (Association Rules Algorithm) to identify ways to improve sales. 
    Explain the rules (patterns) identified, and visually represent the rules in graphs for a clear understanding of the solution.
    


# CRISP-ML(Q) process model describes six phases:
 
1. Business and Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Business and Data Understanding :

Objective(s): Increase the Revenue, increase sales

Constraints: minimizing the risk of customer alienation.


'''Success Criteria'''

Business Success Criteria:  Achieve a 25% improvement in the current annual revenue.

ML Success Criteria: Achieve a high level of accuracy in associations in the transaction data using the Association Rules Algorithm. 

Economic Success Criteria: Reduce operational costs

data collection:

dataset of books is availbale in our lMS website.
